Program description:
           The owners of Movies Club Agency need to develop an application to automatically manage the services in the agency.
           The services are divided into two types:
            1. Watch movies online.
            2. Rent movies on DVD format.
For the first service (watch movies online), the client can directly access the web page of the agency, select the movie
to watch and then the client should pay to watch it. In this case, once the client selects the required title, the
application informs the client the total price that he/she should pay. If the client agrees, then he/she pays introducing
his/her complete name, and the number of the credit card and its expiration date.
For the second service (rent movies on DVD), the client can rent a DVD of any movie for a period of time (at least one
day and there is not maximum limit of days).*/
